        Sammy was low<br />Just watching the show<br />Over and over again<br />Knew
        it was time<br />He'd made up his mind<br />To leave his dead life
        behind
      </p>
      <p>
        His boss said to him<br />Boy, you'd better begin<br />To get those
        crazy notions right out of your head<br />Sammy, who do you think that
        you are?<br />You should've been sweeping up the Emerald bar
      </p>
      <p>
        Spread your wings and fly away<br />Fly away, far away<br />Spread your
        little wings and fly away<br />Fly away, far away<br />Pull yourself
        together<br />'Cos you know you should do better<br />That's because
        you're a free man
      </p>
      <p>
        He spends his evenings alone in his hotel room<br />Keeping his thoughts
        to himself he'd be leaving soon<br />Wishing he was miles and miles
        away<br />Nothing in this world, nothing, would make him stay
      </p>
      <p>
        Since he was small<br />Had no luck at all<br />Nothing came easy to
        him<br />Now it was time<br />He'd made up his mind<br />This could be
        my last chance
      </p>
      <p>
        His boss said to him<br />Now listen, boy<br />You're always dreaming<br />You've
        got no real ambition<br />You won't get very far<br />Sammy, boy, don't
        you know who you are?<br />Why can't you be happy at the Emerald bar?
      </p>
      <p>
        So, honey<br />Spread your wings and fly away<br />Fly away, far away<br />Spread
        your little wings and fly away<br />Fly away, far away<br />Pull
        yourself together<br />'Cos you know you should do better<br />That's,
        because you're a free man<br />Come on, honey
      </p>
