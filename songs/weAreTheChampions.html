        <h3>Lyrics</h3>
      <p>
        I've paid my dues Time after time I've done my sentence But committed no
        crime And bad mistakes I've made a few I've had my share of sand Kicked
        in my face But I've come through And we mean to go on and on and on and
        on We are the champions, my friends And we'll keep on fighting till the
        end We are the champions We are the champions No time for losers Cause
        we are the champions of the World I've taken my bows And my curtain
        calls You brought me fame and fortune And everything that goes with it I
        thank you all But it's been no bed of roses No pleasure cruise I
        consider it a challenge before The human race And I ain't gonna lose And
        we mean to go on and on and on and on We are the champions, my friends
        And we'll keep on fighting till the end We are the champions We are the
        champions No time for losers Cause we are the champions of the World We
        are the champions, my friends And we'll keep on fighting till the end We
        are the champions We are the champions No time for losers Cause we are
        the champions of the World
